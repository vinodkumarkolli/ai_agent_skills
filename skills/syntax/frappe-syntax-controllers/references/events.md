## Event Trigger Sources

Events are triggered by multiple sources. The execution order is:

1. **Controller method** (defined in the controller class)
2. **doc_events from hooks.py** (from all installed apps)
3. **Server Scripts** (if configured for the event)
4. **Webhooks** (if configured for the event)

All four run in sequence for each event. NEVER assume your controller method is the only handler.

## Events That Run on Every Save

These events run regardless of whether the document is new or existing:

- `before_validate`
- `validate`
- `before_save`
- `on_update`
- `on_change`

To distinguish new vs update inside these hooks:

```python
def validate(self):
    if self.is_new():
        # First save (insert)
        pass
    else:
        # Subsequent save (update)
        old = self.get_doc_before_save()
```

---

## Events That Run Only Once

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `before_insert` | Only on first save (insert) |
| `after_insert` | Only on first save (insert) |
| `autoname` | Only on first save (insert) |
| `before_naming` | Only on first save (insert) |
| `on_submit` | Only on submit |
| `on_cancel` | Only on cancel |
| `on_trash` | Only on delete |

---

## doc_events Mapping

The `doc_events` hook in `hooks.py` uses the controller method name as the event key:

```python
doc_events = {
    "Sales Order": {
        "validate": "app.events.so_validate",       # Runs after controller validate
        "on_update": "app.events.so_on_update",      # Runs after controller on_update
        "on_submit": "app.events.so_on_submit",      # Runs after controller on_submit
        "on_cancel": "app.events.so_on_cancel",      # Runs after controller on_cancel
        "on_trash": "app.events.so_on_trash",         # Runs after controller on_trash
        "after_insert": "app.events.so_after_insert", # Runs after controller after_insert
        "before_insert": "app.events.so_before_insert",
        "on_change": "app.events.so_on_change",
    }
}
```

Wildcard `"*"` applies to ALL DocTypes:

```python
doc_events = {
    "*": {
        "after_insert": "app.events.log_all_creations"
    }
}
```

ALWAYS use the function signature `def handler(doc, method=None):` for doc_events handlers.
